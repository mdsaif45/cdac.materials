# Algorithms and Data Structures Using Java

Welcome to the course on Algorithms and Data Structures Using Java. This course is designed to teach you the fundamental concepts of problem-solving, computational thinking, algorithms, and data structures using the Java programming language.

## Course Overview

The course is divided into several sections that cover the following topics:

-   Basic data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues.
-   Recursion and its applications.
-   Trees and their applications.
-   Searching algorithms such as linear search, binary search, and interpolation search.
-   Sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, and quicksort.
-   Hash functions and hash tables.
-   Graphs and their applications.
-   Algorithm designs such as divide-and-conquer, greedy algorithms, and dynamic programming.
-   Analysis of different types of algorithms.
